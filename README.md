# bsng-plugins
CodeWarrior 6 project files of various BSNG plugins I made for macintoshgarden.org

Each file is compressed with StuffIt to preserve resource forks. Each archive contains the project files for that plugin. Buck's Serial Number Generator (BSNG) 2.6+ is required to actually use the plugins. They will also only work with Classic versions of BSNG.

# Important Files
* **\Libraries**: Contains various libraries necessary to compile the plugins.
* **\_My * Template.sit**: Contains the template files I use to quickly make plugins.
